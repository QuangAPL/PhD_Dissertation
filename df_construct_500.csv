technology really dealt anything harm unforeseeable technology system uninterpretable place known unknown unknown unknown make regulation hard school part alondra nelson neither school actually think enough scholar researcher want information think way empirical question question information feel think plant flag either camp say likely case probably thing mean always harm foresee anticipate use

transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show think conundrum tackle big large often unknown situation new human society ezra klein appreciate comparison one thing appreciate comparison think human mind often work regulator mind policymaker mind often work explicitly worryingly implicitly analogy curious analogy used heard area project find convincing alondra nelson think climate change nuclear harm one come immediately mind say automated technology use phrase think sui generis sure quite think analogy think kind quilt analogy put together help u think looming potential harm possible solution much interested certainly nuclear space couple generation activity around nonproliferation know potentially thing thing tool destroy world going work collectively going work across sector globally imperfect way try mitigate damage moreover already seen damage tool unleashed fatal damage tool certainly national security space piece much think akin potential risk potential strategy intervention come nuclear nonproliferation space climate space think uncertainty example weather pattern weather get unpredictable becomes radical think third analogy pandemic still

choice think one thing hope coming moment chatgpt immense possibility automated technology bring world good bad really think choice architecture presented u accepting around possible ezra klein one thing notice analogy primarily analogy risk catastrophe laugh covid want take overly strong position critic covid since beginning nuclear risk problem something lot people feel staunched capacity technology good worried risk nuclear proliferation much affordable abundant nuclear energy today afraid downside course climate change going take strong position think analogy inter one debate policy space want staunch technology offer great good potentially economic growth scientific discovery creativity empowerment think positive side analogy concern analogy offering weighted towards negative alondra nelson think nuclear actually quite good example fusion energy promise possibility inexhaustible green energy able harness fusion energy fusion research development effectively form nuclear energy extremely exciting transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show lot thing along way get science right still lot work site facility engage community around work inform

ongoing risk assessment try monitor tool ongoing way initial question work government really offer affirmative vision work science technology making automated system generative need ongoing work never stop model national institute standard technology developed risk assessment framework think another way government trying ezra klein framed draft bill right power bill right exists metaphor refers

something research space generally retina tell u something social variable thing become use case law government governance really come bear particular way music playing ezra klein first line first principle safe effective system bill right automated system developed consultation diverse community stakeholder domain expert identify concern risk potential impact think question consultation mean even openai point released policy vision document saying believe need open public consultation system standard say one outlined bill bill framework look transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show tell bit thinking input get enough consultation make sure consultation sufficiently representative mean consultation followed mean democracy washing google hold couple town hall say
