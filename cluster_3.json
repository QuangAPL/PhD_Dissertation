unleashing powerful artificial intelligence world little regulation guardrail put many people edge nascent use integration everything healthcare law enforcement war already shown u tremendous danger pose worried joined someone help u understand risk ai pose hopefully mitigate risk vincent conitzer computer science professor carnegie mellon university professor c philosophy head technical ai engagement institute ethic ai university oxford book coming february moral ai get vincent thanks joining vincent conitzer thank dana taylor want start oxford unique approach ethic ai important philosophy teach u approach ai regulation vincent conitzer see ai touching many different area life right trained primarily computer scientist training really designed exactly thinking want deploy ai world constraint want put traditionally computer science focused primarily actually make system work better course important see ai deployed world raise lot question actually want see excerpt podcast ai unleashed concerned technology deployed want allow want disallow kind feature want technology come back become technical question term change technology work desirable way first question actually want see technology first place want see think really important conversation includes computer scientist really people wide variety discipline requires expertise law social science medicine much one field think philosophy natural starting point broad philosopher institute ethic ai actually ranging lot different focused expertise course bring people discipline institute dana taylor think appreciate promise ai field healthcare law enforcement even military setting great concern area let start healthcare two recently filed lawsuit claim ai tool denied care kept loved one alive much danger relying ai healthcare field pose vincent conitzer great question ai healthcare many way promising concern see technology evaluated deployed careful somebody study claim got good result mean practice work well often difference introduced practice maybe image taken somewhat different way setup somehow different maybe work well population actually treated maybe racial bias data used train system first place work well different population concern general need careful system evaluated dana taylor okay let pivot ai law enforcement written extensively ai use facial recognition many u think great help u catch criminal perfect ethical legal concern vincent conitzer use ai law enforcement controversial particularly use facial recognition always work well advertised ideally use catch criminal put somebody behind bar deserves great thing lot concern technology actually work know lot study facial recognition work well everybody particular people darker skin generally tend processed well technology people lighter skin number reason particularly concern use technology law enforcement saw story recently apparently police department actually using another tool start somebody dna company claim able generate picture face person based dna take face run facial recognition think u field react nervously two system failure mode stacking top concern dana taylor excerpt podcast ai unleashed concerned vincent hardly talk danger ai without talking use armed combat according guardian israeli defense force admitted deploying target creation tool called gospel make targeting choice life death consequence biggest concern think ai use war vincent conitzer lot concern autonomous weapon usually imagined drone operated human actually making decision using ai often human loop making kind decision make u little bit comfortable know least human point process helping make decision lot question right may human loop approves decision lot detail worked responsible way put human decision end human feel pressured approve every single decision maybe particularly meaningful human loop lot question decision made ethical perspective rely human ethical reasoning meanwhile put human position well good setup instead rely ai moral reasoning raise lot question whether ai system really able make decision well dana taylor obviously big year politics one story six year ago cambridge analytica used ai illegally harvest ten million facebook profile try sway people election generative ai mimic candidate audio video spread misinformation disinformation anything done ensure election integrity vincent conitzer yes u u upcoming election much top mind course happening election around world see party trying interfere election misinformation sometimes misinformation ai generated well example actually saw new hampshire voter receiving robocalls apparently president joe biden telling go vote fact president biden seems ai generated know possible mimic somebody voice even mimic appearance make fake video becoming challenging somehow able tell ai generated still telltale sign find example looking somebody eye video seems likely technology become better better least naked eye become hard people able tell deep fake u citizen requires start think information coming trust information receiving skeptical information coming ca necessarily trust see course ca necessarily trust read maybe extent familiar another concern party may start able build detailed model u individual done help ai sometimes data leak sometimes even legitimately procured data lead effective advertising get world get personalized information sent u context election particularly concerning course people world really want steer election particular way including people outside country dana taylor excerpt podcast ai unleashed concerned want turn something concern u fraud way ai used trick people giving either money access sensitive information importantly guard vincent conitzer one concern phishing attack somebody try get sensitive information password access system concern ai particular may make possible much larger scale conduct fairly sophisticated phishing attack gotten email generic trying get u something easily tell something personalized ai maybe get much targeted information one concern ai done much cheaper much greater scale see use deep fake already seen example somebody receives call ostensibly child child tell oh men need transfer amount money account course extremely concerning often deep fake child sitting next room hopefully parent actually know concerning dana taylor well vincent far focused talking danger ai pose promise hold solving kind problem make life demonstrably better share thought vincent conitzer absolutely course many u went ai research first place felt opportunity make world better place already talked application ai healthcare course application ai environment facing lot challenge well science interacts well maybe material science seen protein folding ai really help u learn lot world well well potentially improve really important deployed sensible way keep eye danger result well somebody use latest ai system actually design better virus toxic chemical lot work done well dana taylor talked lot risk ai little regulation u help u guard thing regulation effectively help u mitigate risk vincent conitzer tricky thing ai touching many different area life one way seems make sense focus specific application using ai make employment decision requires different kind regulation use ai healthcare one route tailored law focus specifically use ai one kind domain time seems make sense think regulating ai potentially higher level actually extent motivated recently see ai large model become extremely effective lot thing start get integrated lot downstream application good hope regulation challenging requires think lot resource attention able right quickly adaptively enough actually effective dana taylor vincent

transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show think conundrum tackle big large often unknown situation new human society ezra klein appreciate comparison one thing appreciate comparison think human mind often work regulator mind policymaker mind often work explicitly worryingly implicitly analogy curious analogy used heard area project find convincing alondra nelson think climate change nuclear harm one come immediately mind say automated technology use phrase think sui generis sure quite think analogy think kind quilt analogy put together help u think looming

automated technology able going back founding mandate government science technology policy move forward innovation quickly mitigate harm best bill right lay kind affirmative vision surprise anybody listening thing guess tie back started conversation anchor value best outcome human being anchor policy value proposition technology supposed mean world people use whether talking used four year ago released four month assertion still true system safe privacy around data algorithm used discriminate process say two think really important generative conversation well two area thinking guardrail deployment risk assessment use red teaming example public consultation certainly tried ezra klein say quickly red teaming people familiar alondra nelson sure yeah red teaming send tool colleague system beat stress test approach way adversarial try get try break try get use best worst anticipate way supposed used try figure break effect take insight improving tool system second area deployment ongoing risk assessment try monitor tool ongoing way initial question work government really offer affirmative vision work science technology making automated system generative need ongoing work never stop model national institute standard technology developed risk assessment framework think another way government trying ezra klein framed draft bill right power bill right exists metaphor refers right violated sue power force document alondra nelson think thing mean one go back original founding document united state bill right say thing remain true time look back bill right perfect amendment interpretation change time society changed fundamental thing true american society law vision framework law book enforced existing making authority used meant remind u law endure suggest way law policy norm already moved space new technology think broader philosophy important technology move incredibly fast experienced acutely last couple month need stop everything reinvent everything every time new technology transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show social compact change new technology emerge pivot back foundational principle embodied tech policy work technological development specific practice algorithmic risk assessment auditing red teaming ezra klein want get status document little bit deeply one thing going go detail detail imagine document coming legislative proposal administration mentioned law book use regulation book use absolutely true instantiate bill right require quite dramatic new legislation saying publish create many case train algorithm conform standard setting process insisting come came framework discussion something company adopt voluntarily view saying show general congress take make law something sue company follow something good thing company keep mind build model move vision force control bill right powerful vision sue violate able sue openai conform alondra nelson audience document participant led creation multifaceted first instance certainly say still working government president called congress act space protect people privacy move space competition antitrust lot interesting draft legislation around enforcing algorithmic impact assessment around prohibiting algorithmic discrimination way continue make sure innovation robust sure piece legislator piece developer lot document attempt distill best practice best use case learned discussed people developer business leader people working industry case general public endeavor make something think often abstract people lot bring ground use case including showing folk existing authority existing way think go back think saying broader philosophy go back beginning conversation live world growing risk regard one say live world going increasingly different new technology mean think critical emerging technology policy space government fact innovation rich innovation cycle rich mean think ezra different way think role government role policymaking mean create new law every time new technology say foundational principle practice even technology change capacity create whole new way living american society government whole new way imagining american society every time new technology continue technology move fast anchor fundamental value principle ezra klein going honest think really answer question really raised document document number think really profound idea legibility quote say know automated system used understand contributes outcome impact transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show right say think consensus view even developer understand system often coming view conform think plain language reading saying stop make system interpretable way currently interpretable tell right guess one question reading section right another rephrase first question law alondra nelson think something congress say developer release system safe something best try take account alondra nelson right let see align thinking specific use case let think space employment hiring practice let think particular authority equal employment opportunity commission authority enforce civil right around hiring practice around employment decision change algorithmic tool used case developer algorithmic system tell u system make decision want separate speculative case tool trillion parameter variable possibly know come back believe true case vendor creating algorithm company using make decision around employment know algorithm created able someone claim around discrimination space employment tell algorithm used extent trade secret proprietary information give insight process used employment decision ezra klein think way convinced separate narrow broad system building trillion parameter generalized system trying offer million different us know coming know going trading algorithm using system expect going brought business strategy decision making public think decide going enforce legibility rule going say need able tell u ended making decision say hey predictive machine train corpus data spit prediction want know mean company going build differently talk people time know getting answer getting think one question whether within bill within view system congress public say hey make legible keep building bigger one rolling believe safe protect right need interpretability beyond actually built figured build going put way great analogy think draft bill right car amount regulation put car built putting regulation guy point actually increased innovation auto manufacturing space quite bit made higher fuel standard et cetera interpretability higher point point alondra nelson point intersecting human being people opportunity access resource someone building laboratory laboratory setting need legibility legibility need come congress act rule maker lawmaker act space domain say certain thing done around human society transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show legibility rule really applies specific use case car safety example example employment case talked housing discrimination access housing health care access health care resource health care service let revisit take point want separate narrow generative want separate use case affect people lived experience one think right lot generative addition consumer platform using still space transitioned different tool get transitioned different tool generative use employment tool going abide labor law civil right law regard employment case exactly saying developer going figure going want use tool abide law ezra klein one thing hear somebody optimistic sanguine pretty high level opacity illegibility system price pay actually work think good canonical example feed system retinal information basically look eye really understand able detect gender looking retina seem able system seem tell u figure picking letting something think predict gender retina say ok care talk say screening patient certain kind cancer health care probably place going fairly high level regulation cancer screening matter system accurate possible able explain reasoning fact slow system try get explain reasoning well maybe rolling detection system people dying public sector making everything move slowly think kind alondra nelson actually disagree use case think necessarily need kind legibility talking space need let pull thread retina case used screening travel someone told travel tell travel person citizen kind protection talking known bad actor somebody right travel constrained use retina tool tell actually confirm accurate legibility rule something law able say person right person able invoke right know right constrained different large scale medical testing looking retinal scan tell u something research space generally retina tell u something social variable thing become use case law government governance really come bear particular way music playing ezra klein first line first principle safe effective system bill right automated system developed consultation diverse community stakeholder domain expert identify concern risk potential impact think question consultation mean even openai point released policy vision document saying believe need open public consultation system standard say one outlined bill bill framework look transcript ezra klein interview alondra nelson ezra klein show tell bit thinking input get enough consultation make sure consultation sufficiently representative mean consultation followed mean democracy washing google hold couple town hall say see got public input even follow actually ensure consultation meaningful alondra nelson great question think particular challenge face technology particular think space intersects policy expertise becomes increasingly abstract think unfortunately abstracted democratic process blueprint bill right trying part grow democratic constituency around issue mentioned openai case done consultation called think see already rollout chat bot generative tool way little bit engagement changed think think moment profound political opportunity opportunity democracy part tool becoming went policymaker trying explain people automated technology implication five year year sometimes quite challenging became tool everyone almost immediately million user know engaged using chatgpt something say technology think even though hoped rollout let put thing wild see happens lot consultative tremendously important people expert understand role voice think figuring consultation look increasing social need one hand growing kind consultation kind policymaking mean say people unless know build house voice policymaking around housing similar think science technology policy space hand space expertise getting lot smaller mean lot people working computer science data science expert form algorithmic form generative still need keep lane think conversation understanding open think surprised hear say actually quite optimistic moment company saying need increasing consultation opportunity general public really coming understand technology mean ezra klein always thrilled anybody optimist show anything pessimist way natural space let suggest two thing worry see lacking public sphere talk policymakers talk member congress think translated one think speaking maybe congress primarily much
