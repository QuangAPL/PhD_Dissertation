danger relying ai healthcare field pose vincent conitzer great question ai healthcare many way promising concern see technology evaluated deployed careful somebody study claim got good result mean practice work well often difference introduced practice maybe image taken somewhat different way setup somehow different maybe work well population actually treated maybe racial bias data used train system first place work well different population concern general need careful system evaluated dana taylor okay let pivot ai law enforcement written extensively ai use facial recognition many u think great help u catch criminal perfect ethical legal concern vincent conitzer use ai law enforcement controversial particularly use facial recognition always work well advertised ideally use catch

get world get personalized information sent u context election particularly concerning course people world really want steer election particular way including people outside country dana taylor excerpt podcast ai unleashed concerned want turn something concern u fraud way ai used trick people giving either money access sensitive information importantly guard vincent conitzer one concern phishing attack somebody try get sensitive information password access system concern ai particular may make possible much larger scale conduct fairly sophisticated phishing attack gotten email generic trying get u something easily tell something personalized ai maybe get much targeted information one concern ai done much cheaper much greater scale see use deep fake already seen example
