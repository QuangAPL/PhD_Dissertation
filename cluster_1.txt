music playing kevin roose casey newton welcome show friend casey newton hey ezra kevin roose thanks u ezra klein right talking monday chatgpt kicked era released big anniversary party sam altman got temporarily fired company almost collapsed rebuilt microsoft think people expected mark anniversary year roughly whole new world want talk changed year place want begin capability system seeing one hearing know actually used someone semi condition system today year ago kevin kevin roose well first obvious capability improvement model become called multimodal year ago chatgpt take text input output text response prompt model take text output image take text output video take voice data output voice data model working many type input output year ago obvious difference woke nap took look capability market thing probably notice first ezra klein want pull something almost sound developing call sens recognize real danger anthropomorphizing system trying one thing different sens get information help u learn world eye information help u learn world ear et cetera transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show one constraint model much training data becomes multimodal seem radically expand amount training data text internet audio youtube podcast audio spotify something apple podcasts lot data learn world theory make model smarter capable kind recursive quality kevin roose absolutely mean part backdrop capability improvement race quality data lab obsessed finding new undiscovered data source use train model run text scraped entire internet got go podcasts youtube video source data keep improving model casey newton worth though think availability training data interesting past year think interesting chatgpt gave average people way interact first time box type ask anything often get something pretty good response even year folk using think fully discovered everything used think people experiencing vertigo every day think mean job career important thing actually box type get question kevin roose yeah agree think paused new development think still probably take next five year society adjust new capability midst ezra klein made point place casey lot advance come going user interface interact system way big advance chatgpt system behind around ability speak guess write natural language created huge cultural moment around product actually year ago interface underlying capacity power casey newton mean developer day update openai week back world knowledge system updated april year able get something closer time knowledge world event integrated microsoft bing get truly information way impossible chatgpt launched sound relatively minor thing ezra start chaining together start building right interface actually start see beyond internet know today see world web google starting point everything online little box computer type get answer without ever visiting web page going take many year unfold beginning easy see kevin roose one capability exist year ago least public product ability bring data model claude first language model used ability say upload pdf say research paper page long help summarize analyze chatgpt thing know bunch system moving direction company tried spin language model trained internal data business want internal chatgpt use employee ask say question document thing company building sexiest application something enormous demand transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show ezra klein one thing seems getting better tell others coding often ask people whether using bot often basically nobody say yes unless coder everybody say oh yeah played around thought really cool sometimes use midjourney make picture kid email newsletter coder say using time become completely essential curious hear bit capability increase kevin roose think become part daily habit programmer tool github copilot basically chatgpt coder finish whatever line code working help debug code broken study test think one test github ran gave two group coder task one group allowed use github copilot one group group github copilot finished task percent faster group without radical productivity increase tell programmer tool make percent faster going want use every day ezra klein see functionally chatbots wild see different version people used somewhat derisively call fancy autocomplete right help finish line code help finish email ask question ask search engine spot elbow give answer hopefully right maybe right think search implication interesting time case bing made great stride google people moved asking kind bing chatbot question opposed asking google everybody feel need thing think raise money silicon valley moment generative play built product built business strategy true minute crypto one people make crypto analogy think crypto largely vaporware largely real silicon valley faddish people know use thing everybody try put thing product actually gotten way better casey newton use one example app familiar called notion productivity collaborative software write newsletter save every link put newsletter notion inside notion notion couple thing one look every link save write summary nice see glance story recently added feature amp database say hey big story meta past week start pulling essentially querying database built early beginning see world taking data stored somewhere turning personal research assistant great right give think bad kevin roose share another example use talking week ago doctor friend friend doctor get ton message patient

act writing help think thing thinking actually emailed kind answer need give mean know personally difference thought scanning thing editing thinking thing diminishing response flip thing hearing anybody say thing keep waiting interested thing able better doctor reading jack clark import newsletter today super recommend people want follow advancement field talking mean system tested system deployment better picking pancreatic cancer certain kind information doctor keep waiting hear something going field something save people bit time around edge agree productivity improvement fine build business around promise sam altman sat week ago however long moving best world ever mean paperwork going get little bit easier complete meant cure new disease meant new kind energy possibility interested program model create thing exist casey newton well get need system reason right system good reasoning think past year seen move little away way thinking year ago sort fancy autocomplete making prediction next word still true way able create kind facsimile thought interesting way get going ezra facsimile thought need something improved reasoning capability maybe come next generation frontier model think disappointed ezra klein need different kind model something lingers back head interview show demis hassabis deepmind run integrated deepmind google program deepmind built system

different kevin roose well casey cover meta long time may insight sense couple problem one arrived late generative specifically facebook many year considered one top two lab along google came recruiting talent putting cutting edge research presenting paper big conference one big dog funny thing happen released model called galactica right chatgpt released last year supposed science research paper think three day people started noticing making fake citation transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show hallucinating model meta felt different tarnish people already worried fake news facebook got pulled chatgpt shortly thereafter launched became global sensation grappling technology built real obvious business case shoving chatbots product facebook instagram sell enterprise software microsoft really shove paid subscription product sense talking folk sure technology built flinging open mass think casey newton track basically get either basically explained investing ton obvious return investment near term future say celebrity chatbots made quite bad ezra klein horrible casey newton truly baffling thing taken celebrity celebrity playing given celebrity silly name follow instagram send message say hey character snoop dogg portraying think silly expect die rapid death sometime next year see better idea say somebody wake nightmare morning lot folk san francisco go listen yann lecun talk one ever relaxed yann lecun army superhuman assistant live inside computer going anything want risk harming ever feeling anxious go listen yann ezra klein think right led policy difference meta much open source approach openai google seem think irresponsible something happening think built around different view safety view safety yann lecun important figure whole world much chill know name founder casey newton mean part think deeply held conviction someone expert space pioneer understands technology certainly far better see killer robot respect viewpoint respect given credential space think question open source safer still open question pun argument safer well open source mean average people go look code identify flaw see machine work point public fixed public whereas something openai building powerful system behind closed door kind access need rely government regulator see safe system argument favor open source course flip side well take powerful open source model put open web even true anyone poke hole identify flaw true bad actor take model use something really really bad happened yet certainly seems obvious possibility time near future ezra klein let use bridge safety generally talked bit system gone past year seem going lot concern transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show unsafe fundamentally become misaligned understand kind breakthrough investment attention safety kevin kevin roose lot work gone called model basically making large language model several phase phase one called training basic process take data shove neural network learns make prediction next word sequence called basically trying turn model something actually useful tailored turn chatbot turn tool doctor turn something social process includes thing reinforcement learning human feedback lot leading model work continued progress model say today safer le likely generate harmful output previous generation model field interpretability lot reporting past month tiny subfield trying figure gut language model look actually happening inside one model ask question give prompt produce output huge deal think people want know thing work satisfied saying mystical black box understand going inside model understand example model start lying start becoming deceptive thing safety researcher worry process interpretability research think really important minor breakthrough field past year still slow going still hard problem crack casey newton think worth pausing underscore kevin people building system know work know high level lot within show individual output able tell exactly run query multiple time get slightly different answer researcher tell endless debate safety one reason tend lean side folk scared exact point end day still know system work ezra klein tell track think compared year ago talked safety people people worry become misaligned terrible damage really badly misused seem think actually pretty good year think able keep big model course much le powerful one day expect invent think pretty good keeping aligned made progress interpretability totally clear year ago many people potentially problem solve least making breakthrough relaxed people worry often say need long time fully understand even thing may long nevertheless get sense safety people seem little confident technical work paying least impression got reporting prior casey newton think right mean sam altman particular strategy going release stuff lab going wait see society reacts give time let society address release next thing think best way slowly integrate life transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show asked maybe month ago month using chatgpt odds something really really bad happening availability chatgpt put much higher turned talk folk openai tell company really taken safety really seriously see use product ask question sex basically call police lot system built far kevin roose say thing heard safety researcher feeling relief world ended people worried lonely thing many year someone worried safety apparent reason worried safety right chatbots siri alexa terrible one imagine thing become dangerous harmful technology advanced congressional hearing regulation coming multiple country people geoff hinton yoshua bengio two godfather deep learning proclaiming worried technology headed think people working stuff long time palpable relief oh carry shoulder anymore world aware system risk pose ezra klein one irony read talking people safety going better technical matter expected think worse matter governance intercorporate competition regulatory arbitrage hoped fear understand make technical breakthrough needed kind coordination necessary go slow enough make lot fear think feel actually going worse better casey newton one big narrative coming sam altman firing must something safety based reporting reporting shared many others safety issue much story discussed whole affair folk board associated safety idea taken huge hit public reputation way handled firing think really bad outcome firing safety community loses credibility even though safety far tell really lot happened sam altman ezra klein yeah first agree clearly safety behind whatever disagreement altman board heard side believe believe finally convinced guy disagreement seems fundamental mean governance going worse openai people thought important sam altman talked importance time nonprofit board connected nonfinancial mission value building served humanity fire sam altman time even shut company fundamentally thought going awry way another moment board tried think try strong ground moment tried turned company fundamentally reconstitute microsoft board withstand pressure coming back think argument board side mostly defunct board go badly press reporting brought board member crony sam altman greg brockman sam altman greg brockman board going investigation altman maybe stronger board better able stand altman one argument heard transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show hand stronger board member hold view safety board member left helen toner georgetown tasha mccauley rand held mean people going interested whether openai making money saying care thing people know run company serve corporate board normal way output corporate board supposed shareholder value going influence even understand different mission mean getting story wrong kevin roose think right speaks one interesting strangest thing whole industry people started company weird say normative judgment made weird decision thought exciting amazing wanted build terrified point developed elaborate safeguard mean openai case put nonprofit board charge subsidiary gave essentially nonprofit board power push button shut whole thing wanted anthropic one company structured public benefit corporation version nonprofit board capable essentially pushing big red shut button thing get crazy silicon valley typically structure mark zuckerberg harvard dorm room building facebook thinking thing becomes powerful communication platform history technology need put place check balance keep becoming powerful kind thing people started openai anthropic thinking think seeing kind structure bowing requirement shareholder capitalism say need money run company train model going make concession power shareholder money think one big piece fallout openai drama openai going structured run much traditional tech company kind holdover nonprofit board casey newton sad story truly wish worked way think one reason company built way helped attract better talent think many people working idealistic want create harmful thing really optimistic power good technology people say powerful good thing really dangerous take really seriously want empowered want company board folk lost much ground past couple week truly tragic development think development industry music playing ezra klein one thing say yeah always going government strange nonprofit corporate structure actually seen huge amount government activity recent week want start u biden announced big package big executive order call regulation call casey describe sum biden administration approach signaling regulating casey newton big headline going train new model successor us certain amount energy energy proxy powerful capable model tell federal government done inform safety testing model releasing public transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show one break attempted put development industry say train model specify safety test say going go road touch u think slightly decelerate development model think critic say push u little bit away open source version open source development chaotic nature want giant open source project compete gpts world harder big takeaway ezra klein one thing struck looking order go back year go back two year think thing people government understand barely conversant technology people remember senator orrin hatch asking mark zuckerberg well making people pay make money read order looked actually struck pretty seriously engaged instance big debate world whether going regulate based complexity power model use model fear happens using model medical decision using personal assistant care whereas safety people view personal assistant model actually really dangerous one one know act real world biden administration take real actually take view safety people model certain level computing complexity want higher level scrutiny higher level disclosure want everything come watermarked way see struck biden administration actually clearly taken seriously convened set group stakeholder expert knew mean necessarily agree literally every decision lot asking report think framework regulation read framework coming people thought minute casey newton absolutely quite impressed chance meet ben buchanan white house worked talked stuff clear

every regulator trying think future harm model regulating time stop thing harm going judgment call judgment call going hard one make ever got point somebody needed flip switch say anybody actually credibility seen fact lauded successful company run smart people huge twitter following thread following whatever end actually much public power always able make case political economy actually better hope company get right nobody really going capability stand front casey newton talk folk really worried safety think high possibility point let say next five year trigger sort event kill multiple thousand people event speculate assume true think change political debate lot sudden start see jet get scrambled hopefully never happens think inciting moment thing frustrates somebody writes tech policy live country pas law endless hearing endless debate get time regulate something well yeah regulate going based one regulation passed deal oat farming crisis going hope applies pas new law country know law need passed today ensure go well certainly congress going need something point stuff evolves kevin roose mean one thing thinking whole situation openai playing actually financial crisis scene captured book movie head investment bank scrambling avoid going meeting boardroom people ben bernanke chair federal reserve government actually critical role patching together financial system interested bank survived failed making sure banking system market opened next monday think need new regulatory framework kind clich\u00e9d word stakeholder someone representative government saying resolution conflict make sense american people around world ezra klein looked government gave power document think play role need call government way read spread power across lot different agency place invested rather le one thing different people called see part actually need pas law actually create department something funded structured built exact thing central clearinghouse inside government led somebody credible issue maybe size strength kind research thing head find analogy really compelling kevin federal reserve federal reserve big institution significant power term setting interest rate huge amount research think public option come transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show need something money research hiring really excellent people case economist case researcher nothing assertion le structure need le law need apply thing creatively say big deal need new institution point person kevin roose yeah mean think correct think reason think want government technological capacity come previous wave innovation certainly nuclear power manhattan project thing internet came darpa area government significant technical expertise building technology competition private sector public sector equivalent chatgpt government built anything even remotely close think worth asking need happen government capacity evaluate regulate system actually build ezra klein think genuinely strange level given important bill gathering steam look private sector think worth pumping billion company help make better enterprise software seems weird imagine public problem economic value equal significantly larger may want pay money fine infrastructure right mean passed gigantic infrastructure bill thought infrastructure actually spend lot money broadband seems want think way think kind fecklessness cowardice part political culture longer think capable thing least think show probably think prize system say bunch thing want see solved build system solve give billion one thing government thing spend money uncertain return building giant system spending lot money uncertain return part government probably something defense department area know make feel better make feel worse laugh take kevin roose yeah mean think piece labor talent probably order several thousand people world oversee building training deployment large language model specific skill set people make gob money private sector working wherever want number hear coming place openai engineer paid mean football compensation package people government simply pay much money someone equivalent work public sector saying paying engineer million dollar taxpayer money build thing need wanted compete open market top talent ezra klein saying saying fecklessness cowardice point stupid kevin roose think engineer working federal government making million year ezra klein look maybe million year thing think civil servant make much people private sector know somebody congressional hearing going stand person making lot money way rob public value transcript ezra klein interview casey newton kevin roose ezra klein show google wrong microsoft wrong create thing social value believe leaving mean intend make profit public get great gain necessarily profit cure different disease make big advance energy way thinking actually really significant problem sure need pay

servant paid well saying jim jordan get grill former deepmind engineer labor department paying million language model sure answer going ezra klein agree mean think saying way thing problem government dumb thing jim jordan say going great government take advantage opportunity public good suck better differently thought differently let ask china china one hand least paper regulation look much tougher one version maybe regulating much strictly another view heard fact true company chinese government making sure building strong extent looked understand chinese regulatory approach differs casey newton mean looked mostly standpoint system look think couple month since china approved first consumer usable chatgpt equivalent imagine strict requirement far chatbot say tiananmen square wind limited maybe use united state far happening behind closed door defense system sort thing dark kevin roose four five year ago started reporting book conventional wisdom among researcher china ahead
